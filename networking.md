# Networking Services

To keep your sensitive information safe and comply with regulations, it’s critical to protect your entire corporate network—including branches and mobile workers—from existing and potential threats.

## Citrix ADC Deployment

After learning about your networking goals, our experts will deploy the appropriate Citrix ADC solution. They will follow leading practices and proven designs so you can quickly begin reaping the benefits of your Citrix investment.

## Cloud Native Design and Deployment

Our cloud experts will work with you to identify your business drivers, shape your cloud approach, and develop a detailed cloud architecture. To support this architecture, we will define leading practices and migration strategies, and ensure you have a solid blueprint and plan for implementing this design.

## Migration to Citrix ADC

We’ll migrate your environment from an F5 application delivery controller (ADC) to Citrix ADC to achieve faster scalability and higher app performance, reduce TCO through consolidation, and cloud-enable your data center. We will gain an understanding of your existing iRules and help port them to a new Citrix ADC environment so you can hit the ground running with minimal disruption.

## Network Protection Strategy

Defend your network from application-layer attacks with Citrix Web App Firewall, a web application firewall (WAF). We’ll evaluate your environment to design and implement a security strategy that protects web applications and assets from known and unknown attacks.

## Network Access Strategy

Based on your specific needs, we will implement a use-case-driven forward proxy and policy configuration to manage and prioritize traffic based on user permissions and URLs.

## Citrix SD-WAN Deployment

Software-defined networking (SDN) can overcome limitations of traditional networks by accommodating data and applications that are hosted in the cloud and delivered as a service, or downloaded by employees onto mobile devices. We’ll deploy Citrix SD-WAN at your main data center and then provide a blueprint for your team to install the required SD-WAN hardware at each endpoint to ensure a smooth and successful deployment.
