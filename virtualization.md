## Digital Workspace Transformation

We’ll help you simplify your IT architecture by transitioning from a distributed model with point solutions to Citrix Workspace, which will natively reduce your attack surface. Our experts will show you how your organization can benefit from additional features and services that complement current Citrix Virtual Apps, Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops, and Citrix ADC deployments.

## Digital Workspace Design

We’ll conduct an assessment to understand your current environment and needs. Then we’ll develop a detailed blueprint based on leading practices for migrating your legacy systems to Citrix Workspace.

## Digital Workspace Deployment

Based on your specific needs and our validated designs, we’ll deploy a customized secure digital workspace solution. We’ll also develop detailed deployment documentation to seamlessly transition, scale, optimize, and manage your environment as needed.

## Digital Workspace Security Assessment

Our CISSP-certified consultants will review your virtualization, networking, mobility, and data-sharing environment for security vulnerabilities. Based on leading practices around contextual access, networking, analytics, and application data, we’ll provide recommendations for mitigating risks and preventing future attacks.
